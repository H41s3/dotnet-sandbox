# csharp-basics

Just some C# stuff I wrote while learning .NET fundamentals.

## What's in here

| Folder | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `myApp` | Playing around with operators - arithmetic, bitwise, ternary, etc |
| `ifStatement` | Number to word converter using if-else chains |
| `SwitchStatement` | Same thing but with switch (way cleaner tbh) |
| `DoCasting` | Figuring out how type casting works between int and double |
| `Microwave` | Quick program that calculates heating time based on item count |
| `objectOrientedProgram` | Basic OOP stuff - made an Animal class and a Dog that inherits from it |
| `consoletest` | Hello world, nothing special |

## Running

Need .NET 9 SDK installed. Then just:

```bash
cd <folder>
dotnet run
```

## Notes

- Each folder is its own project with its own `.csproj`
- Most of these are just me experimenting with syntax
- The microwave one was from a class assignment
